# FlowerPower
A little Satisfactory mod that adds a recipe for converting flower petals to biomass. To unlock the recipe, you need to complete a new tier 1 research project at the HUB.

## Installation
Just download it with the Satisfactory Mod Loader. For additional information, visit https://ficsit.app/mod/FlowerPower
